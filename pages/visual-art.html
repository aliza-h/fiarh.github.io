			<p>I've been drawing cartoons since 4th grade. I was way into anime all through middle school, and that obsession influenced my art style. As I moved through high school, I began moving away from anime, and I began to branch off into my own experimental styles.</p>

			<p>I certainly don't take drawing as seriously as I used to, which I honestly think makes it a whole lot better. It definitely makes it more fun.</p>
