				Everything I do comes from a place of creative inspiration. (Wee-woo insert <em>I am an artiste</em> line here.)
			</p>
			<p>
				I love writing and worldbuilding. Seriously, worldbuilding is the <em>best.</em> Immersing myself in other worlds, universes, or mindsets is fascinating to me. I love exploring how characters' minds are shaped by the worlds and relationships around them.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a geek. (No shit.) I get super-invested in shows, books, movies, etc. That's where I got my start with fanfiction; I wanted to fill in the gaps, invent new situations, and just generally explore the world beyond the original work. Fandoms are awesome communities because we can all just be insane together&mdash;and believe me, I need a vehicle with which I can spew my uncensored weirdness out into the ether.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a perfectionist, too. I am <em>meticulous</em> with the stuff I create.<br/>
				At the same time, though, I know where to stop. Complete perfection is boring&mdash;not to mention impossible.<br/>

					A computer system known as the Legion has ruled over the abandoned city of Cordell for centuries, killing any living thing within its borders. Androids and other robots roam the streets at all times, vicious machines programmed to kill.
				</p>

				<p>
					A human settlement has formed around the city, surrounding it, and the people there know to keep well away from the Legion.
				</p>

				<p>
					Some people, however, don't want to keep away. Some people want to find out what the Legion really is&mdash;or was. Ailith Elliott was one of those people, and she ventured into the city, hoping to find answers... but her search, like all the others, ended in death.
				</p>

				<p>
					Eighteen years later, Ailith's daughter, Rae, wants revenge. But she can't do it alone.
				</p>

				<p>
					With a group of four sharp-minded allies at her side, Rae Elliott enters the city with one goal in mind: Stop the Legion for good.
				</p>

				<p>
					But the Legion is not what it seems, and when Rae and her team unearth the truth, it will change everything.
