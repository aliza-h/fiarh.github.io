<p>I was hesitant to go into software development at first because *how the hell would I have the attention span to become a programmer?* But I've found that I actually LOVE programming because it gives me so much creative freedom. It's black-and-white logic to create grey-area experiences, and I love that. It's an artistic medium like no other.</p>

<p>Everything I do comes from a place of creative inspiration. (Wee-woo insert *I am an artiste* line here.)</p>

<p>I love writing and worldbuilding. Seriously, worldbuilding is the *best.* Immersing myself in other worlds, universes, or mindsets is fascinating to me. I love exploring how characters' minds are shaped by the worlds and relationships around them.</p>

<p>I'm a geek. (No shit.) I get super-invested in shows, books, movies, etc. That's where I got my start with fanfiction; I wanted to fill in the gaps, invent new situations, and just generally explore the world beyond the original work. Fandoms are awesome communities because we can all just be insane together. And believe me--I need a vehicle with which I can spew my uncensored weirdness out into the ether.</p>

<p>I'm an individualist to the core. I've never been one to follow the crowd. I never will be.</p>

<p>I'm a perfectionist, too. I am *meticulous* with the stuff I create.<br/>
At the same time, though, I know where to stop. Complete perfection is boring--not to mention impossible.<br/>
