		<div class="desc2">
			<p>
				I'm studying software engineering at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. It wasn't really a conscious decision for me to become a software developer or work in IT or anything like that&mdash;I kind of just gravitated toward it through talking to friends and taking a couple high school programming classes. I didn't know if this would actually be something I'd enjoy.
			</p>
			<p>
				But now that I'm here, I couldn't be happier.
			</p>
			<p>
				Believe me, I was hesitant at first because <em>how the hell would I have the attention span to become a programmer?</em> But I've found that I actually <em>love</em> programming because it gives me so much creative freedom. It's black-and-white logic to create grey-area experiences, and I love that.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's an artistic medium like no other.
