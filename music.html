		<!-- general description -->
		<div class="desc">
			<p>I'd dreamed of playing electric guitar for as long as I could remember. During the summer of 2017, when I was 16 years old, I turned that dream into a reality when I bought my first electric guitar with my own money.</p>
			<p>I've always had an ear for music; I loved playing piano by ear, and my band instructor later told me I had perfect pitch.</p>
			<p>Reading music was never my thing. I preferred to cut out the middleman and just <em>play...</em> so that's what I did.</p>
			<p>It's what I still do today, and I love doing it.</p>
			<p>My passion lies in rock and metal instrumentals.</p>
